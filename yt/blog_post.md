Artificial intelligence (AI) is a broad field aiming to create intelligent machines. Machine learning (ML) is a subset of AI where machines learn from data without explicit programming. Deep learning (DL), a subset of ML, uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns. Data science involves extracting knowledge and insights from data, utilizing techniques from AI, ML, and DL.
